# Crop Yield in Kyrgyzstan
## Introduction
The economy of Kyrgyzstan, a landlocked nation in Central Asia, is heavily reliant on agriculture. A sizable section of the populace makes their living from farming and raising animals. Agricultural production becomes an important problem for national development because of the difficulties posed by mountainous terrain, a continental climate, and the changing effects of climate change.
The purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of agricultural and environmental variables, including temperature, precipitation, and pesticide use, on crop productivity in Kyrgyzstan. The objective is to comprehend past trends and spot patterns that can help forecast the future and guide the formulation of agricultural policies.
